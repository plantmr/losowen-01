Traditional family run tea room serving English grown tea in bone china cups and traditional crockery for cakes and cream teas. All our cakes and scones are home made on the premises by Susan and our team of excellent cooks create the delicious specials and other meals. We serve traditional cream teas together with modern twists of chocolate cream tea with chocolate chip scones, chocolate spread and clotted cream and Gentleman’s cream tea with cheese scones with red onion marmalade and cream cheese. We cater for all dietary requirements so our Vegan, Gluten/Dairy free customers have the same choice from the menu to choose with friends and family. We are busily increasing our range of vegan/vegetarian meals as well as delicious recipes for 'normal' diets. Our staff always extend a warm welcome to all our customers to give you that extra special feeling of comfort and service and dogs are always welcome.
